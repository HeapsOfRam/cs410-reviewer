# cs410-reviewer

reviewing [sarcasm detection in news articles project](https://github.com/GBLUIUC/CS410-Course-Project)

please check the [revise directory](./revise/) for the changes i had to make to get things to work on my system.
specifically, i needed python version: `Python 3.8.15`

i also modified [the requirements.txt file](./revise/src/requirements.txt) and added a [classifier.py file local to the server](./revise/src/classifier.py)
